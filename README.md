<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![Screenshot of the website](screenshot.png)

This project is an Apple shop checkout page built with HTML and CSS. It features two main sections: a product summary and a contact form where users can enter their name, email, and country. The goal of the project is to practice layout techniques using Flexbox. It was built as part of a frontend challenge to strengthen HTML and CSS skills.



### What I learned

Throughout this project, I gained a better understanding of flexbox, positioning, and how to overlay backgrounds.
I encountered some difficulties with centering elements and realized that I need to invest more time in planning how to structure the project layoutâ€”both horizontally and vertically. This will help me avoid issues and reduce the need for manual adjustments with margins and padding to achieve proper alignment.

### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs : for HTML and CSS reference
- W3Schools : for HTML and CSS reference

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Custom CSS Properties


## Features

This site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.

## Acknowledgements

The course I took at Digital Learning Hub laid the foundation for my understanding of HTML and CSS, while the YouTube course by <a href="https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=DJpaxBdoFtuAD_lU">SuperSimpleDev</a> further strengthened and deepened my knowledge.
