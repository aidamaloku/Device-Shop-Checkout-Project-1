## Overview

![Screenshot of the website](Screenshot%20-%20Project-1.png)

I worked on some other, simpler projects as well. Before starting this one, my goal was to build a solid understanding by continuing after my course at the Digital Learning Hub, which laid the foundation. I aimed to deepen my knowledge through YouTube tutorials and by learning from documentation. To avoid getting stuck in theory alone, I wanted to actively apply what I had learned through this project, which I deployed using Netlify. After completing this project, I plan to work on the remaining challenges on DevChallenges. [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard)



### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

Throughout this project, I gained a better understanding of flexbox, positioning, and how to overlay backgrounds.
I encountered some difficulties with centering elements and realized that I need to invest more time in planning how to structure the project layoutâ€”both horizontally and vertically. This will help me avoid issues and reduce the need for manual adjustments with margins and padding to achieve proper alignment.

### Useful resources

- MDN Web Docs : for HTML and CSS reference
- W3Schools : for HTML and CSS reference

### Built with

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Custom CSS Properties


## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This site was created as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges-dashboard) challenge.

## Acknowledgements

The course I took at Digital Learning Hub laid the foundation for my understanding of HTML and CSS, while the YouTube course by <a href="https://youtu.be/G3e-cpL7ofc?si=DJpaxBdoFtuAD_lU">SuperSimpleDev</a> further strengthened and deepened my knowledge.
