<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview


<!--
Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- What have you learned/improved?
- Your wisdom? :)
-->



### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

Throughout this project, I gained a better understanding of flexbox, positioning, and how to overlay backgrounds.
I encountered some difficulties with centering elements and realized that I need to invest more time in planning how to structure the project layout—both horizontally and vertically. This will help me avoid issues and reduce the need for manual adjustments with margins and padding to achieve proper alignment.

### Useful resources

MDN Web Docs – for HTML and CSS reference
W3Schools – for HTML and CSS reference

### Built with

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Custom CSS Properties


## Features
